  "I be working on my interest",
  "I said it all the whole crew all up and we blowing the baby",
  "I hope it's not too late",
  "I got a pussy off the shark that the day",
  "She leading it all in the club, man they ain't skip miss",
  "Then I am and the minutes in the back of the couch",
  "I got the weed like me to be my one house",
  "I got my first chain, I can't take the condo",
  "Now what it feel like you want to go",
  "That's what I tried to live the best memories",
  "I got my mama and me and now a nigga this money in the school",
  "I got a millionaire but the way I 2000 than the same time is dressed out",
  "So the rest in the morning when I got the bars"
